To compile my program, you can type on terminal:
make

To get information of the FAT32 file named 'a4image', run 'info' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image info

To get list of file name and name of directories inside the FAT32 file named 'a4image' run 'list' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image list

To get the specific file name such as 'PANDP.TXT',  run 'get' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image get BOOKS/PANDP.TXT

So this will write out a file with same name to same folder pf this program, the information to write to this file is not all completed but it can write some information out to the file with same name. For example, file 'PANP.TXT'

To clear the program, you can type:
rm A4FINAL
