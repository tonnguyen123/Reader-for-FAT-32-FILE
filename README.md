To compile my program, you can type on terminal:
make

To run 'info' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image info

To run 'list' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image list

To run 'get' command, you can type on terminal:

./A4FINAL a4image get BOOKS/PANDP.TXT

So this will write out a file with same name to same folder pf this program, the information to write to this file is not all completed but it can write some information out to the file with same name. For example, file 'PANP.TXT'

To clear the program, you can type:
rm A4FINAL


I tried my best to make this program, hope you give some good consideration for my hard work. I would appreciate a lot

Thank you so much!
